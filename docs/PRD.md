## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

1. Enable seamless multi-model access — support multiple Replicate model endpoints (including custom models) in a unified interface
2. Eliminate context switching — allow model switching without leaving the application or losing workflow continuity
3. Automate configuration management — implement preset system to auto-apply model-specific settings (trigger words, optimal parameters)
4. Maximize custom model utilization — make custom-trained models (helldiver, starship-trooper, firebeardjones) as accessible as standard models

### Background Context

The application is currently hardcoded to a single Replicate model endpoint, forcing users to navigate between different Replicate pages to access different models. This breaks creative flow and wastes 2-5 minutes per model switch. Custom-trained models remain underutilized due to access friction. The solution transforms this into a flexible multi-model creative platform that preserves workflow continuity and maximizes the value of custom model investments through unified access and automated preset management.
